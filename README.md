# Chlamy-repeats-mutation
Analysis for the paper "Rates and patterns of mutation in tandem repetitive DNA in six independent lineages of Chamydomonas reinhardtii".

FileS1 - This file goes through the genome-wide description of tandem repeats in 6 different strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  

FileS2 - This file details the analysis of paired-end reads to determine interspersion between repeats (when there are repeats on both mate pairs)  

FileS3 - This file goes through the analysis of mutation rates and patterns in genome-wide tandem repeats in 85 mutation accumulation lines from 6 ancestral strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  

All Supplementary files have corresponding folders with the input files required to run the scripts to produce the output as presented in the manuscript. The perl scripts referred to in FileS3 are located here: https://github.com/jmf422/Daphnia-MA-lines/tree/master/InterspersionAnalysis  

As described in the methods, we used scripts for GC correction located here: https://github.com/jmf422/Daphnia-MA-lines/tree/master/GC_correction  

In order to run the Rmd scripts yourself, only the file paths will have to be updated. However, for convenience, we also included all complete compiled html files.  

If you have questions/comments about these scripts and analyses, please contact Jullien Flynn at jmf422@cornell.edu.
